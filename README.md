# RHCSA Practice Labs

This repository contains hands-on lab exercises and scripts to prepare for the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** exam.

Each folder contains focused tasks covering major RHCSA topics:

- **users/**: User and group management
- **permissions/**: File/directory permissions, ownership, ACLs
- **storage/**: LVM, partitions, mounting, and storage config
- **services/**: Managing system services with `systemctl` and `journalctl`
- **networking/**: IP configuration, hostname, firewall basics
- **cron/**: Scheduled tasks with `cron`, `at`, and timers

This lab environment is built using **Rocky Linux 9** on **VirtualBox**, closely aligned with RHEL 9 exam standards.
